Share your home, apartment, or vacation property privately with people in your network. 
Don't let your vacation property sit empty most of the year just because the local government banned Airbnb and publicly listed vacation rentals. Stayy lets you share your properties privately with friends and family so you don't need to worry about strangers having parties or messing up your beautiful getaway spot.

üè° Increase your vacation rental bookings by flexing your social networks. 
Stayy makes it easy to manage scheduling and set reimbursement or cleaning fees without friends having to awkwardly ask for a place to stay or ask for a 'mates rates' discount. Avoid the social cost of saying no to friends when they can now simply check your property availability on Stayy. Set availability by person, bedroom, or for the entire place, vacations are more fun with friends anyway.
